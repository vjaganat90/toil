# We have to guarantee that "When a WDL author uses a File input in their

# substituted when that declaration is referenced in the command template."

# outside-the-container host filenames, and inside-the-container filenames. But
# the MiniWDL machinery only gives us 2 levels to work with: "virtualized"
# (visible to the workflow) and "devirtualized" (openable by this process).

# So we sneakily swap out what "virtualized" means. Usually (as provided by
# ToilWDLStdLibBase) a "virtualized" filename is the Toil filestore URL space.
# But when evaluating a task command, we switch things so that the
# "virtualized" space is the inside-the-container filename space (by
# devirtualizing and then host-to-container-mapping all the visible files, and
# then using ToilWDLStdLibTaskCommand for evaluating expressions, and then
# going back from container to host space after the command). At all times the
# "devirtualized" space is outside-the-container host filenames.
